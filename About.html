                <p>I am a first-year bachelor's student studying Computer Science at Texas College of Management and IT. I am passionate about web development and eager to learn and grow in the field of technology. My current focus is on building a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>While I am early in my academic journey, I have already begun exploring projects related to front-end development and database management. I enjoy tackling coding challenges and collaborating with peers to create innovative solutions.</p>
                <p>Outside of academics, I am involved in student organizations related to technology and participate in tech conventions to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. I am excited about the opportunities ahead and committed to continuous learning to become a proficient developer.</p>
                <p>My goal is to leverage my education and passion for technology to contribute meaningfully to projects that make a positive impact on society. I am enthusiastic about exploring internship opportunities and gaining hands-on experience to complement my studies.</p>
